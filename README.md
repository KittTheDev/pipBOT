# pipBOT

Have you ever play *Nuclear Winte*r mode in **Fallout 76** and see that 'bot' jumping until the storm or something else kill the guy ? *" what a criminal ! "*

Well..There he is ! The new version of this **pipBOT 3000** is back ! *yay* !!

With more feature like **pipBOY AFK** while doing boring event or waiting here & there trying to sell your plan! (looser!) 


## Instructions *(from noob to pro)* :

Fallout 76 is known for having a somewhat ineffective "anti-cheat / anti-bot" system. I won't delve into the details of how it works, but basically, if you use a "flag" application like **Cheat Engine**, Bethesda will get you flagged and potentially banned. That why it could be a better option to run a script and not run a .exe (In case Bethesda flag the pipBOT.exe)

Now, here we're talking about using a bot (which goes against the terms of use, right ? Let me check the Pip-Boy manual...). So, for the bravest among you, go ahead and use the .exe (it's in the build folder). The risk of getting banned is low but not impossible. To counter that, you can use the pipbot.py script and run it!

## What's inside ?

Well, you have 2 button to press !

- **START (pipboy AFK)** 


Sit / Sleep / Use any Workshop and press START . Easy right ? Well you can now farm any Event or Waiting somewhere in the Appalachia.

- **START (Frog AFK)**

This is just the Frog AFK we used to see in Nuclear Winter ! Now useless but this "bot mode" will still remain here as a reminder of the great Nuclear Winter ! 

- **STOP**

Did i have to explain this one ?

**When you start the bot please get back to the game otherwise, the inputs will affect Windows or who knows where!**
